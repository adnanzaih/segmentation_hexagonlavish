TODO:
1) Thresholding: This technique involves converting an image to a binary image by setting a threshold value for pixel intensity. Pixels with intensity above the threshold are set to 1, and pixels with intensity below the threshold are set to 0.

2) Watershed Algorithm: This is an image segmentation algorithm based on the "catchment basin" concept. It segments an image by treating it as a topographic surface and flooding it from different markers (seeds) until basins are formed.

3) K-Means Clustering: This is a popular clustering algorithm that is often used in image segmentation. It groups similar pixels together based on their color or intensity values.

4) Graph-Based Segmentation: This technique involves representing an image as a graph, with pixels as nodes and edges representing similarity between pixels. The segmentation is then performed by partitioning the graph into clusters.

5) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are widely used for image segmentation tasks, They are trained with a dataset and can classify each pixel of an image.

6) Semantic Segmentation: This is a deep learning based technique which segments an image by classifying each pixel into one of the pre-defined classes.

7) Instance Segmentation: This is a variation of semantic segmentation, but it goes a step further by also identifying individual instances of each object class in an image.
